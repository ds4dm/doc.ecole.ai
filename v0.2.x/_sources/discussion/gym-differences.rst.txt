Differences with OpenAi Gym
===========================

Contrarily to `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`_ where learning tasks are predefined,
Ecole gives the user the tools to easily extend and customize environments.
This is because the objective with Ecole is not only to provide a collection of challenges
for machine learning, but really to solve combinatorial optimization problems more
efficiently.
If different data or changing the tweaking the control task delivers better performances,
it is an improvement!
